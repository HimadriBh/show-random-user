# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a react application which displays a list of users and single user information based on the 
user clicked.

This project is uses an API called Random User Generator: 
url: `https://randomuser.me/api/`

This project uses the  api to display the name of the user on left side i.e. the Sidebar component.
It also show the information of the user, on the right side which is UserDetails when a user name in the sidebar is clicked.

The project uses other libraries like, react-router-dom, redux, react-redux and redux-thunk to basically show how we one can implement these libraries in a react application.
